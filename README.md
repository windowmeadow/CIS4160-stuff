# CIS4160-stuff


I have no clue what I'm doing<br/>
my coding experience? 0 (practically)<br/>
my github knowledge/commits/anything? 0<br/>
level of nervosity about this course knowing that i'm about to fail? 999999<br/>
<p>
okay anyway hello this is my readme for the CIS4160 stuff but tbh i have no clue what to do esp for this first thing so i hope what I have is good anyway
